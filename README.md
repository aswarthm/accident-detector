# accident-detector
## Problem Statement  
The aim is to develop innovative solutions that leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques to detect and respond to accidents in a timely and effective manner. Accidents can occur on roads, in workplaces, or in public spaces, and prompt response is crucial to minimize damage, injuries, and loss of life.  
  
## Problems We Faced  
* We couldn't integrate Bard with javascript and had to switch over to python
* Had a tough time integrating firebase with cloud functions
* Had difficulties in uploading the DL model onto the Raspberry Pi
